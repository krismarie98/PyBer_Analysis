# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis was to look at all the data and be able to break it down into smaller subpoints. More specifically it was to look at the different city types and make comparisons. By the end of the analysis we wanted to look at each city types fare for the week. This was shown by use of a line graph and several other graphs throughout the project.
## Results:
### By looking at the PyBer_fare_summary graph we can see how urban cities had the higher fare overall and rural cities had the least. There are other comparisons made throughout this analysis including a look at the the total rides, total drivers, total fare, average fare and other useful data of each city type. By Looking at the data you can see that though rural area had the least amount of rides, they had the highest average fare per ride. Urban cities actually had the lowest average fare per ride, though they had the highest total fare and the highest amount of rides.

## Summary:
### When looking at the data it is easy to see though Urban cities make more, they also have to take more rides for a shorter length based on the fare. In contrast, Rural cities make less but earn more on average per ride. To address this it is recommend to try and encourage Rural riders to use the driver services. This would increase the Rural cities profits and the average fare could stay the same because of the area type. In reference to Urban cities, my recommendation would be to find new or current riders that would be interested in taking longer rides therefore increasing the average fare per ride. Additionally, I would recommend getting any data in regards to the amount of drivers available and the amount of rides that were not fulfilled. This would allow to see if Rural city types or any other city types are lacking the approiate driver amount.

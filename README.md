# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis was to look at all the data and be able to break it down into smaller subpoits. More specifically it was to look at the different city and make comparisons. By the end of the analysis we wanted to look at each city types fare for the week. This was shown by use of a line graph and several other graphs throughout the project.
## Results:
By looking at the PyBer_fare_summary graph we can see how urban cities had the higher fare overall and rural cities had the least. There are other comparisons made throughout this analysis including a look at the the total rides, total drivers, total fare, average fare and other useful data of each city type.
